# Movies and TV 2 Watch 🎥📺🍿
  
 Movies and TV 2 Watch is an app that shows you what movies/tv shows you can search for and watch.
  It searches for movies and tv shows by:
  <ul>

  <li> Most Popular Movies 🎥 </li>
  <li>Top 10 TV Shows 📺
  <li>Most Popular TV Shows 📺</li>
  
  
  
   ## ✳️How It Works✳️
   

<li> Rest API Http request protocol</li>
<li> DOM manipulation to render the data for the user</li>
<li> Retrieve the data object</li>
<li> The app fetches the response from the server and renders the proper information for the user in the html.</li>
<li> The search history is saved locally everytime a search is made and updates the search history dropmenu list</li>
<li> The app can be closed and the search history will be displayed next run time</li>
